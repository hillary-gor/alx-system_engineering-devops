# User Accessing Website:
This represents a user who wants to visit the website hosted at www.foobar.com. They initiate this process by typing the website's address into their web browser.

# Domain Name (www.foobar.com):
The domain name serves as the user-friendly address that people use to access websites. In this case, it's "www.foobar.com," which is what the user types into their browser's address bar.

# DNS (CNAME record):
The Domain Name System (DNS) is like the internet's phone book. It translates human-readable domain names (like www.foobar.com) into IP addresses that computers understand. The CNAME record specifies that the "www" subdomain of foobar.com points to the server's IP address, 8.8.8.8.

# Server (8.8.8.8):
The server is a powerful computer responsible for hosting the website and handling user requests. It's represented by the IP address 8.8.8.8.

# Web Server (Nginx):
The web server (Nginx) receives incoming requests from users' browsers. It's responsible for managing these requests, handling static content (like images and CSS files), and forwarding dynamic content requests to the application server.

# Application Server:
The application server executes the code that makes the website work. It processes requests that require dynamic content, such as filling in user-specific information on a webpage.

# Application Files:
These are the files that contain the website's codebase, scripts, and assets. The application server runs this code to create the dynamic content that users see.

# Database (MySQL):
The database stores structured data needed by the website. MySQL is a popular database management system used for this purpose. It can store and retrieve data like user profiles, product information, and more.

# Communication (User's Computer <-> Internet <-> Server):
When a user wants to access the website, their computer communicates with the server over the internet. This interaction occurs using protocols like HTTP or HTTPS, allowing the user to request and receive web content.

# Issues:
Single Point of Failure (SPOF): Since all components are on a single server, if it goes down, the entire website becomes inaccessible.
Downtime During Maintenance: Any maintenance or updates, like deploying new code, requires restarting the web server, leading to website downtime during these activities.
Limited Scalability: With just one server, handling a large influx of traffic can be challenging, potentially causing slow performance or crashes.
